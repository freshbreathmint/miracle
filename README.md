# Miracle Framework

## About

Miracle Framework is an in-development software framework designed to streamline the process of building and managing C-based projects. By offering a robust system for project setup and configuration, it simplifies application development. For an in-depth understanding of the framework, please refer to the [About Page](doc/About.md).

To develop a project using this framework, it is highly recommended to use the **Miracle Framework Extension** for Visual Studio Code. The extension enables quick configuration, project and library initialization, and seamless build/run functionality. For detailed instructions on utilizing the extension, see the [VSC Extension Guide](doc/VSC%20Extension.md).
