# Overview

The Miracle Framework is designed to be non-intrusive, requiring minimal setup. You can set up your application and project by running a single script.

Currently, you can set up the application folder using the `setup-workspace.sh` script. This script copies the `miracle.code-workspace` file into your project folder. After running the script, open the workspace file in Visual Studio Code.

In the future, this script will also automatically create any necessary directories or files required by the Miracle Framework. For more information, please reference the [Roadmap](Roadmap.md).
