   - Establish a streamlined system for loading and executing application libraries.
2. **Develop Hot Reloading Capability:**
   - Implement a system for hot reloading libraries when new versions are compiled.
   - Extend the hot reloading system to support application hot reloading.
3. **Implement Profiling System:**
   - Design and develop a method for profiling functions within the application library.
4. **Finalize and Optimize:**
   - Ensure that hot reloading and profiling features are fully operational and stable.
   - Review and finalize project documentation for version 1.0.0.
   - Develop and deploy an application to demonstrate the core features of the framework.
5. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Identify and plan the next set of core features for future framework updates.

## Timeframe

Ideally version 1.0.0 should be complete by the end of September 2024.
