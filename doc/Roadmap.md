## Overview

This document outlines the planned development milestones and features for the Miracle Framework. It serves as a guide for future enhancements and priorities.

## Development Milestones

1. **Application Initialization Configuration:**
   - Configure what libraries the framework should compile and load through an initialization file provided to the user. Configure the name of the executable and the icon it uses.
2. **Hot Reloading System:**
   - Implement a system for hot reloading libraries when new versions are compiled.
   - Extend build system to support this feature as a baseline.
2. **Implement Profiling System:**
   - Design and develop a method for profiling functions within the application library.
3. **Windows Build Automation**: 
   - Develop build scripts and tasks for automating Windows builds.
4. **Finalize and Optimize:**
   - Ensure that hot reloading and profiling features are fully operational and stable.
   - Review and finalize project documentation for version 1.0.0.
   - Develop and deploy an application to demonstrate the core features of the framework.
5. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Identify and plan the next set of core features for future framework updates.

## Timeframe

A version 1.0.0 will have all of these features described above. I aim aiming to be done with at least the hot reloading and application initialization configuration part of this by the end of September 2024.
