## About

This document serves as a roadmap for the tasks that need to be completed during the development of Project Miracle. For now, it will function as a 'to-do' list.

## Roadmap

1. **Define Basic Functionality:**
   - Determine the core features and how they will function within the framework.
2. **Initiate Project and Prototype:**
   - Start the project in Visual Studio Code.
   - Develop a robust build system.
   - Create a prototype based on the defined core features.
3. **Iterative Development:**
   - Continue developing the project until the core features are refined.
4. **Finalize and Optimize:**
   - Get the project to a state where all core features are working as intended without issue.
   - Refine and finalize project documentation for version 1.0.0
5. **Project Completion:**
   - Create and deploy an application *designed* to demonstrate the core features.
   - Create and deploy a moderately simple application and utilize the core features.
   - Slap v1.0.0 on it and call it a day.
6. **Future Enhancements:**
