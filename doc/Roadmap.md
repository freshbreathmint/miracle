# About

This document serves as a roadmap for the tasks that need to be completed during the development of Miracle Framework. For now, it will function as a 'to-do' list.

## Roadmap

1. **Framework Submodule Design:**
   - Reconfigure the project architecture to integrate the framework as a submodule within an application project.
2. **Application Build System:**
   - Adapt the existing build system to support the application project, while maintaining necessary infrastructure within the submodule.
3. **Library Loading:**
   - Establish a streamlined system for loading and executing application libraries.
4. **Develop Hot Reloading Capability:**
   - Implement a system for hot reloading libraries when new versions are compiled.
   - Extend the hot reloading system to support application hot reloading.
5. **Implement Profiling System:**
   - Design and develop a method for profiling functions within the application library.
6. **Finalize and Optimize:**
   - Ensure that hot reloading and profiling features are fully operational and stable.
   - Review and finalize project documentation for version 1.0.0.
   - Develop and deploy an application to demonstrate the core features of the framework.
7. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Identify and plan the next set of core features for future framework updates.

## Timeframe

Ideally version 1.0.0 should be complete by the end of August 2024.
