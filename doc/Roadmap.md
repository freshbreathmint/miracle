## Overview

This document outlines the planned development milestones and features for the Miracle Framework. It serves as a guide for future enhancements and priorities.

## Development Milestones


1. **Hot Reloading System:**
   - Implement a system for hot reloading libraries when new versions are compiled.
2. **Sage Engine Integration:**
   - Incorporate support for Sage Engine into framework VSC extension.
   - Get Sage Engine to a state where we have a main loop so we can figure out how it will work with the Hot Reloading system.
3. **Logging/Profiling:**
   - Get some sort of logging/memory management system implemented.
   - Show memory usage in VSC extension?
1. **Finalize and Optimize:**
   - Ensure that hot reloading and profiling features are fully operational and stable.
   - Review and finalize project documentation for version 1.0.0.
   - Develop and deploy an application to demonstrate the core features of the framework.
2. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Identify and plan the next set of core features for future framework updates.

## Timeframe

A version 1.0.0 will have all of these features described above. I aim aiming to be done with at least the hot reloading and application initialization configuration part of this by the end of October 2024.

After 1.0.0 is done, things should be ready to shift development focus over to trying to develop a basic game or application and adding new features to the framework and Sage Engine as needed.
